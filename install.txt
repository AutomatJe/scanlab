For server you will need to install these packages (Debian as example):

nginx-full mongodb php5-fpm php5-cli
php5-mongodb php5-gd php5-geoip

Debian Wheezy users can find php5-mongodb package in backports repository.

If you are using newest version of PHP (latest Ubuntu or Fedora), you will also need to install:
php5-json

NGINX configuration file can be found in 'other' folder.

Then you'll need to edit file 'inc/example.settings.php' and move it to 'inc/settings.php'.
After that you must go to your site, register your new ROOT user and you are done!
From root panel you can enable API usage for users. This will enable report inserting and all the advanced features of ScanLab.
